# Code of Conduct : Comments

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

## Keep it civil aka don’t be a jerk  

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

+ The use of sexualized language or imagery
+ Personal attacks
+ Ad hominem attacks
+ Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
+ Public or private harassment
+ Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic
  addresses, without explicit permission
+ Self-promotion
+ Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

Comments that we find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing may be removed. If you don’t have something nice to say about another user, don't say it. Treat others the way you’d like to be treated.

## Keep it tidy  

Help make moderators’ lives easier by taking a moment to ensure that what you’re about to post is in the right place. That means:

+ Don’t post off-topic comments or discussions: check the Explore page to find the appropriate channel for your topic
+ Don’t cross-post the same thing multiple times
+ Check if another active discussion on your topic has already been posted
+ English Only

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],
version 1.3.0, available at
